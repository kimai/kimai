## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please read the [Bughunter](https://www.kimai.org/documentation/bughunter.html) documentation before posting, 
and then you can report any security related vulnerability in the [advisories section at GitHub](https://github.com/kevinpapst/kimai2/security/advisories) or via email to kpapst@gmx.net.

I will work as fast as I can to fix the problem and publish a bugfix release / security update. 
Depending on the size of the required fixes, this might take a couple of hours or a couple of days.

You can expect that your message will be answered ASAP. 

You will be mentioned in the release notes if your issue is valid and after it was fixed. 
I am grateful for any (discrete) disclosure of vulnerabilities!
