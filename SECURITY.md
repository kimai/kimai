## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please read the [Bughunter](https://www.kimai.org/documentation/bughunter.html) documentation before posting. 
You can report any security related vulnerability in the [advisory section at GitHub](https://github.com/kimai/kimai/security/advisories) or via email to kpapst@gmx.net.

I will work as fast as I can to fix the problem and publish a bugfix release / security update. 
Depending on the size of the required fixes, this might take a couple of hours or a couple of days.

You can expect that your message will be answered ASAP. 

You will be mentioned in the release notes if your issue is valid. 
I am grateful for any (discrete) disclosure of vulnerabilities!
