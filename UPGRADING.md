# Upgrading Kimai 2

Database upgrades are currently ONLY provided for MySQL/MariaDB and SQLite. 

If you plan on using e.g. PostgreSQL, please read more about the `bin/console doctrine:migrations:diff` and 
`bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate` commands and contact us, so we can integrate them into the official releases.


A normal upgrade can be executed with these commands: 

```bash
git pull origin master
sudo -u www-data composer install --no-dev --optimize-autoloader
sudo -u www-data bin/console cache:clear --env=prod
sudo -u www-data bin/console cache:warmup --env=prod
bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate
```

There might be version specific tasks that need to be executed before or after these steps, please see below 
if your updated version is mentioned below.

## [0.5](https://github.com/kevinpapst/kimai2/releases/tag/0.5) (unreleased)

Some configuration nodes were removed, if you have one of them in your `local.yaml` you need to delete them:
- `kimai.invoice.calculator`
- `kimai.invoice.renderer`
- `kimai.invoice.number_generator`

The new config `kimai.invoice.documents` was introduced, holding a list of directories ([read more](https://github.com/kevinpapst/kimai2/blob/master/var/docs/invoices.md)).

## [0.4](https://github.com/kevinpapst/kimai2/releases/tag/0.4) (2018-09-01)

In the time between 0.3 and 0.4 there was a release of composer that introduced a BC break, 
which leads to problems between Composer and Symfony Flex, resulting in an error like this when running it:

```
  [ErrorException]
  Declaration of Symfony\Flex\ParallelDownloader::getRemoteContents($originUrl, $fileUrl, $context) should be compatible with Composer\Util\RemoteFilesystem::getRemoteContents($originUrl, $fileUrl, $context, ?array &$responseHeaders = NULL)
```

This can be fixed by updating Composer and Flex before executing the Kimai update:
```
sudo composer self-update
sudo -u www-data composer update symfony/flex --no-plugins --no-scripts
```

Then the full update can be executed as usual:

```bash
git pull origin master
sudo -u www-data composer install --no-dev --optimize-autoloader
sudo -u www-data bin/console cache:clear --env=prod
sudo -u www-data bin/console cache:warmup --env=prod
bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate
```

## [0.3](https://github.com/kevinpapst/kimai2/releases/tag/0.3) (2018-07-22)

**Update from 0.2:**

You need to adjust your `.env` file and add your `from` address for [all emails](https://github.com/kevinpapst/kimai2/blob/master/var/docs/emails.md) generated by Kimai 2:
```
MAILER_FROM=kimai@example.com
```

Create a file and database backup before executing the following steps: 

```bash
git pull origin master
sudo -u www-data composer install --no-dev --optimize-autoloader
sudo -u www-data bin/console cache:clear --env=prod
sudo -u www-data bin/console cache:warmup --env=prod
bin/console doctrine:migrations:version --add 20180701120000
bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate
```
